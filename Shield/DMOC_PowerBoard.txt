Looking at the component side of the driver board:

2  4  6  8  10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40
1  3  5  7  9  11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39

1 Gate A Bottom VIN-
2 Driver ground
3 Gate A Top VIN-
4 Driver ground
5 Gate B Bottom VIN-
6 Driver ground
7 Gate B Top VIN-
8 Driver ground
9 Gate C Bottom VIN-
10 Driver ground
11 Gate C Top VIN-
12 Driver ground
13 very weakly floats to 1.5 to 2v but bleeds off rapidly when tested.
14 Not sure, seems to not read any voltage ever
15 Signal Ground
16 Fault output (+5v when not faulted, pulled low when desat fault happens)
17 Signal Ground
18 Fault output (+5V when not faulted, pulled low when desat fault happens)
19 Gate VIN+ for all drivers and gates (5V in)
20 Some sort of AC signal that runs around 70Hz and +/- 3.3v
21 Seems to be 5v while board is active?
22 Seems to always be around 5.3v. Seems to be +5V source from power board.
23 Driver reset (for all drivers and gates)
24 Floats up to +5v but when pulled to ground it enables gate drivers
25 Temperature 1 signal (J3)
26 Very weakly floats to about 2v when not spinning. When spinning pegged at 2v
27 Signal 1 from current sensor board (don't know what this is)
28 Op amp reference for current sensors
29 Sensor CT1-B on current board
30 Op amp reference for current sensors
31 Sensor CT1-A on current board
32 Op amp reference for current sensors
33 Pack voltage reading (1/100 scale so 400v is 4v)
34 Signal ground (connects to current sensors and temperature sensors)
35 Signal Ground
36 Signal ground
37 Temperature 2 signal (J4)
38 Seems to run about 4 to 4.8v while board is active
39 Not sure, seems to not read any voltage ever
40 Signal Ground

PWM pins are 10Khz and rest at high (active low)
