A textfile with various notes to whoever else is interested 
in what's coming down the pike and possibly what they could do:

- The #1 order of business right now is to make sure that it is not necessary
to have a serial connection to the Due in order to function. This should now
be the case. If digital input 0 is set high then everything will go enabled.
If D1 is set high, everything will disable.

-I think that handleTick should be of configurable timing. Perhaps
have the system tick be actually 1ms or 2ms; something fast. And then
each device configures a timeout of between 1 and 255 ticks (a single
byte) and once that # of system ticks has happened the device will get
its handleTick callback. This allows some devices to tick rapidly and some
to tick slowly. For instance, the DMOC needs to send frames around
every 20ms but the pedal could probably be called less frequently.

-Much of the spec document pre-assumes there are certain inputs
and outputs. Such things as gear selection, drive enable, etc. A
standard needs to be constructed for hardware - what pins to use for
what. Along these lines, some form of hardward is needed for I/O. This is
true whether the Macchina or Due is used. Both have the same form factor
so ideally an Arduino compatible I/O shield is needed that works with both
5 and 3.3v

-Inputs:
Throttle Inputs:AI0, AI1
Brake Pressure Input: AI2
Drive Enable: D0
Drive Disable: D1

-Outputs:
Precharge contactor: D8
Main Contactor: D9
Cooling Contactor: D10


Allow Wifi to remote control all sorts of stuff, connect to internet and send
notifications, etc.
